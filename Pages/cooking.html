    <p> Cooking became one of my best hobbies for a few years. 
        Food is something that nobody can live without. Wherever you may be, 
        you may engage yourself in cooking. Cooking became my favourite hobby 
        because it gives me the opportunity to explore my creativity, acts like a
        stress buster,having fun with new recipes and after all, it's all about a healthy
        lifestyle for my family. My cooking recipes includes traditional Indian, Asian, 
        Continental, or Mediterranean. I also find joy in baking cakes, scones and 
        making desserts.</p>
