    <p><h3>Listening to Music</h3></p>
    <p>Listening to music is much more than just a hobby. Only by listening to music
     do we heal mind, body and soul. Music becomes therapeutic even for those who 
     create it. Imagine, playing an instrument that allows you to isolate yourself 
     from the world and dedicate yourself to art. I practise to listen music mainly 
     to reduce stress, stimulate brain cells, increase physical performance and for  
     peaceful sleep. My favourite music are instrumental calm piano music, praise 
     and worship hymns, western music, classical music.
